companion app for [frii-update](https://github.com/bleck9999/frii-update) to make configuration less annoying

using only the finest Qt6 bindings (*modernâ„¢*) this script spawns a 1020x588 box on your cathode ray tube ready for your eyes to molest.
featuring such things as checkboxes*, pushbuttons and even a table for maximum user interfacing, you'll be opening this script just to look at it!

now instead of manually creating a json, you can just type a path and use the very intuitive colour picker (originally created by [nlfmt](https://github.com/nlfmt/)).
it even shoves it into a json for you, and at some point if you decide you don't like a repository anymore, 
you can remove it, and thanks to pain and suffering you can even remove multiple at a time!

surprise new feature: you can now throw your text editor in the recycle bin because frii_update.ini
is now editable using this abomination of a window. simply edit the table and use the new menu bar (wow) to save your changes

now unfortunately if you are one of those old school people who hate these new fangled GUI apps,
command line support has been deprecated in order to make supporting .ini files less painful.  
im sure you probably preferred vim anyway.

in fact, this may even work on other machines and other operating systems, including windows who knows i should probably test this because i have no idea
