companion app for [frii-update](https://github.com/bleck9999/frii-update) to make configuration less annoying

using only the finest Qt6 bindings (*modernâ„¢*) this script spawns a 661x576 box on your cathode ray tube ready for your eyes to molest.
featuring such things as checkboxes*, pushbuttons and even a table for maximum user interfacing, you'll be opening this script just to look at it!

now instead of manually creating a json, you can just type a path and use the very intuitive colour picker (originally created by [nlfmt](https://github.com/nlfmt/)).
it even shoves it into a json for you, and at some point if you decide you don't like a repository anymore, 
you can remove it, and thanks to pain and suffering you can even remove multiple at a time!

but maybe you're old school, and you hate these new-fangled "GUI" things people keep going on about. 
well worry not, because it even accepts command line arguments to do things instead, because everybody knows mice are just bloatware
(run with `--help` to see usage)

in fact, this may even work on other machines and other operating systems, including windows who knows i should probably do some research because i have no idea
